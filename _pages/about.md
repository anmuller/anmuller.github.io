Hello! My name is Antun and currently, I am a PhD student on the subject of human-robot interaction at [INRIA Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en) as a part of the AUCTUS team. My thesis supervisors are [Vincent Padois](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/vincent.padois/) and [David Daney](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/ddaney/).

I've obtained my bachelor's and master's degree at the [Faculty of the electrical engineering and computing (FER)](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en) in Zagreb, Croatia and my background is in mechatronics and control theory. After my studies, I've spent some time abroad, as an intern at the research centers of [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) (Princeton, USA) and [Bosch](https://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/bosch-center-for-research-and-advance-engineering-in-renningen-101888.html) (Stuttgart, Germany).   Before starting my PhD, I've had the opportunity to work as a research associate at the [Mechatronics lab](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/zesa/sk/mehatronika) of the University of Zagreb, under the direction of the professor [Jadranko Matusko](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/jadranko.matusko) and [Sandor Iles](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/sandor.iles). 

<b style="margin-bottom:0px">Research interests</b><br>
The focus of my thesis is to quantify and exploit the robot's and human's capabilities (to generate forces, moments, velocities, accelerations, ...) in the context of human-robot interaction and try to create more human-centered robot control strategies.
- Physics of the human-robot interaction 
- Human and robot capacity estimation
- Polytope enumeration/evaluation methods 
- Human-centered robot control
- Optimal control strategies *( Quadratic programming - QP )* 

<b style="margin-bottom:0px">On a more practical note,</b> my favorite way of learning is by hands-on experimenting and creating educational projects which enable me to test and improve my knowledge (embedded systems, mechanics, electronics, control theory, user interaction, ...). When they go well, I really enjoy documenting and sharing them in a form of the open-source projects, making them available to the wider community. Even making an occasional Youtube video ðŸ˜ƒ.  <br>
One of these projects that I am particularly proud of, is the [*Simple**FOC**library*](/portfolio/1_simplefoclibrary), which aims to demystify the Field oriented control for the Arduino community. The project has exceeded all my expectations both in terms of community interest (more than 400 members) and involvement (20+ contributors)!
